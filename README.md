Smart Menu Options
==================

The module introduces new menu configuration options if the dropdown menu style is selected.

You can now control horizontal and vertical offsets of the dropdown menu layer, show and hide
timeouts, show and hide sub-menu indicators, configure your menu's dropdown to expand from
right to left and from bottom to top, and also to choose alternative collapsible behaviour:
Default, Toggle, Link, Accordion, Accordion  toggle and Accordion link.
